# Variables

[← Language Tour](./index.md)

In Vism, a variable is a name (called `identifier`) that is mapped to a value address.

## Definition

```py
@x = 3
```

We are putting `3` at `x`, i.e. where `x` is some memory address.

## Usage

```py
@x
```

Note that the `@` is also required when using the variable.
